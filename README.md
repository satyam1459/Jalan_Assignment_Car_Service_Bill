<h1 align="center"> Car Service Application(OOPs)ðŸ‘‹</h1>

* This Java application simulates a car service station that offers different types of services for various car types. The application allows users to generate a detailed bill based on the selected car type and service codes.

## Car Class
The `Car` class represents a car and has the following attributes and methods:
- `type`: A private string variable that stores the type of the car.
- `Car(String type)`: A constructor that initializes the `type` of the car.
- `getType()`: A method that returns the type of the car.

## CarServiceApp Class
The `CarServiceApp` class is the entry point of the application. It contains the main method and handles user input for selecting the car type and service codes. It utilizes the `CarServiceStation` and `BillGenerator` classes to generate the bill.

## CarServiceStation Class
The `CarServiceStation` class represents the car service station. It has the following attributes and methods:
- `carTypes`: A `Map` that stores the available car types and their corresponding `Car` objects.
- `services`: A `Map` that stores the available services and their corresponding `Service` objects.
- `CarServiceStation(Map<String, Car> carTypes, Map<String, Service> services)`: A constructor that initializes the car types and services.
- `getServicePrice(String serviceCode, String carType)`: A method that retrieves the price of a service for a specific car type.

## Service Class
The `Service` class represents a service offered by the car service station. It has the following attributes and methods:
- `code`: A private string variable that stores the code of the service.
- `name`: A private string variable that stores the name of the service.
- `prices`: A `Map` that stores the prices of the service for different car types.
- `Service(String code, String name)`: A constructor that initializes the code and name of the service.
- `setPrice(String carType, int price)`: A method that sets the price of the service for a specific car type.
- `getPrice(String carType)`: A method that retrieves the price of the service for a specific car type.

## BillGenerator Class
The `BillGenerator` class generates a detailed bill based on the selected car type and service codes. It has the following attributes and methods:
- `serviceStation`: A reference to the `CarServiceStation` object.
- `BillGenerator(CarServiceStation serviceStation)`: A constructor that initializes the `serviceStation` reference.
- `generateBill(String carType, String[] serviceCodes)`: A method that generates the bill by calculating the total charges for the selected services and displaying the details. It also checks if the total bill is more than â‚¹10,000 and displays a complimentary cleaning message if applicable.

## Usage
1. Run the `CarServiceApp` class.
2. Select the car type from the provided options: Sedan, Hatchback, SUV.
3. Enter the number of services needed.
4. Enter the service codes for each service needed.
5. The application will generate a detailed bill, displaying the car type, service codes, charges for each service, total bill amount, and a complimentary cleaning message if the total bill exceeds â‚¹10,000.

Note: The available service codes and their corresponding services are displayed before entering the service codes.

Feel free to customize the code to add more car types, services, or functionality as per your requirements.
